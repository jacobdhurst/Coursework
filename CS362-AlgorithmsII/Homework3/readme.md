# Nim Neural Network

A neural network to optimally play nim against. Converted from a logical circuit based solver which 
uses Sprague-Grundy theorem to optimally play nim. See sampleruns.txt for sample usages and tests.

## Usage

Run with 'python3 nim_network.py <pile_1_size> <pile_2_size> <pile_3_size>' to start a game of nim
against the neural network with the supplied pile sizes as arguments.
