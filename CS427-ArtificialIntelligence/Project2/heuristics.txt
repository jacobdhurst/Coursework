Black White Tile Problem:
The heuristic used involves counting the number of white tiles to the right of a black or empty tile.
This is accomplished by looking at whats in the first 3 tile spaces. If the first space is not white,
then we know there must be atleast 3 white tiles to the right from here so we add 3 to H. If the second space
is not white, then we know there must be atleast 2 white tiles to the right from here so we add 2 to H. If
the third space is not white, then we know there must be atleast 1 white tile to the right from here so we
add 1 to H. This heuristic is admissible as it evaluates to 0 at the goal state and never overestimates
the remaining moves to be made.

Vampire Werewolf Problem:
The heuristic used involves counting the number of werewolves and vampires to the east of the rio grande
after the move has been made (and dividing by the boat capacity, 2). This heuristic is admissible as 
it is 0 when at the goal state (everyone on the west side), and it never overestimates the distance to
the goal as it only counts the final east value for each given step (which should always be decreasing).
