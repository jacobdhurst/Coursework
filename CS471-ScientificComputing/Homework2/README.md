* This subdirectory contains 2 subdirectories, *code* & *report*. 
* The code for this homework is located in the *code* subdirectory (*hw2/code*). There are two files, '*newton.py*' & '*drive_newton.py*'. There is an additional subdirectory within labeled '*generatedfiles*' that includes some of the tables and plots that were generated in development.
