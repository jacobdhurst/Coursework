* This subdirectory contains 2 subdirectories, *code* & *report*. 
* The code for this homework is located in the *code* subdirectory (*hw5/code*). The subdirectory *preliminary* contains the implementation of the formulas for RK1, RK2, and RK4. There is one file, '*hw5_skeleton.py*'.
* To execute the code on your local machine, open a terminal, *cd* into *code*, & run command *python hw5_skeleton.py*. Currently, *hw5_skeleton.py* generates one plot of flock diameter and one movie of the bird dynamics.
* The report, movies, and flock diameter plots for this homework are located in the *report* subdirectory (*hw4/report*). There are three sub directories: *figures*, *movies*, *tests*. 

* The *hw4/report/movies* subdirectory contains selected movies of the of bird dynamics sampling various cases: predator, smelly bird, etc.
* The *hw4/report/figures* subdirectory contains the plots of flock diameter against steps for cases corresponding to those in *movies* subdirectory.
* The *hw4/report/tests* subdirectory contains movies and flock diameter plots for verious experimentaly varied parameter from the default. The naming convention for files is parameter name on the LHS and parameter assignment ot RHS. For example, the name *movie_2gamma9.mp4* means the movie of when parameter *gamma2* was assigned the value of *9*.
* The file titled '*HW_5_report.pdf*' is our final report.
