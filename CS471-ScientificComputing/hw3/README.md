* This subdirectory contains 2 subdirectories, *code* & *report*. 
* The code for this homework is located in the *code* subdirectory (*hw2/code*). There are four files, '*driver.py*', '*gauss.py*', '*lglnodes.py*', & '*trapezoidal.py*'.
* To execute the code, open a terminal, *cd* into *code*, & run command *python driver.py*. '*driver.py*' automates '*gauss.py*' & '*trapezoidal.py*' on two seperate functions and generates the plots used in our report.
* The report for this homework is located in the *report* subdirectory (*hw2/report*). There are five files but the focus should be on '*HW_3_report.pdf*', the other four files are just the plots generated.
