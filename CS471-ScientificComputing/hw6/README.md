* This subdirectory contains 2 subdirectories, *code* & *report*. 
* The code for this homework is located in the *code* subdirectory (*hw6/code*). TODO What files are contained?
* To execute the code on your local machine, open a terminal, *cd* into *code*, & run command *python hw6_serial_skeleton.py*. TODO How to run the CARC version? What output is produced?
* To execute the code on CARC, move files to CARC, open a terminal, *ssh* into *wheeler.alliance.unm.edu*, & run command *qsub hw6.pbs*. This submits a request for time on CARCs compute cluster. The text files will be generated in the same manner with the addition of two additional output files from CARC (Note: plots may not be generated on CARC).
* The report for this homework is located in the *report* subdirectory (*hw6/report*). The file is titled '*HW6_report.pdf*', there is also an *output* subdirectory* containing relevant files used in making our report.
