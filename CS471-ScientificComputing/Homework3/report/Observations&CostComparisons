**Gauss**

The Gauss plots shown display the error in approximation using Gauss quadrature as a function of the number of weights and nodes, n for the first and second functions of x, respectively. 

Alongside the Gauss quadrature approximation error function, we have provided plots of n^(-2), n^(-4) and n^(-n) for reference. We can observe that the behavior of the Gauss quadrature approximation error function is most similar to n^(-n) and is approaching 0 significantly faster than n^(-2) and n^(-4). This tells us that Gauss quadrature is converging to the exact integral at an exponential order. This general convergence holds for both functions of x.

For the first function of x, we can observe a slight initial increase in error before converging to an error of approximately 10^(-16) at n approximately 10^(1.5).

For the second function of x, we can observe a slightly more noticeable initial increase in error with some fluctuations before converging to an error of approximately 10^(-16) at n approximately 10^(2).

**Cost Comparison**

To compare accuracy between the Trapezoidal Rule and Gauss Quadrature, we can evaluate how many evaluations are necessary to get within tolerance 10^-5 and 10^-10 and compare the number of evaluations needed for each method with each tolerance. We can do this for both functions of x and observe how these functions affect the number of evaluations needed. The output from this evaluation is below.

The trapezoidal rule on function 1 required 10 evaluations with n=2,3,..,11 trapezoids to satisfy the error tolerance 1e-10.
Gauss quadrature on function 1 required 18 evaluations with n=2,3,..,19 weights/nodes to satisfy the error tolerance 1e-10.
The trapezoidal rule on function 2 required 998 evaluations with n=2,3,..,999 trapezoids to satisfy the error tolerance 1e-10.
Gauss quadrature on function 2 required 52 evaluations with n=2,3,..,53 weights/nodes to satisfy the error tolerance 1e-10.

Average Gauss Evaluations: (19 + 53) / 2 = 45.5
Average Trapezoidal Rule Evaluations: (11 + 909) / 2 = 505

In a general setting we can conclude that Gauss may be more efficient as it averages to consistently better behavior, however, if we have periodic functions trapezoid rule can perform very well as seen with function 1 (k = pi).
