* This subdirectory contains 2 subdirectories, *code* & *report*. 
* The code for this homework is located in the *code* subdirectory (*hw4/code*). There are four files, '*hw4.pbs*', '*hw4_skeleton.py*', '*poisson.py*', & '*threading_example.py*'.
* To execute the code on your local machine, open a terminal, *cd* into *code*, & run command *python hw4_skeleton.py*. Currently, hw4_skeleton.py generates 3 text files regarding timing and efficiency. The plots may be generated by uncommenting the 'pyplot' lines of the code.
* To execute the code on CARC, move files to CARC, open a terminal, *ssh* into *wheeler.alliance.unm.edu*, & run command *qsub hw4.pbs*. This submits a request for time on CARCs compute cluster. The text files will be generated in the same manner with the addition of two additional output files from CARC (Note: plots may not be generated on CARC).
* The report for this homework is located in the *report* subdirectory (*hw4/report*). The file is titled '*HW_4_report.pdf*', there is also an *output* subdirectory* containing relevant files used in making our report.
